# **BUBBLE SINGULARITY**

## **A Strategic Space Adventure for 2-4 Players**

*In the vast expanse of space, brave explorers race to manipulate cosmic bubbles, creating powerful chain reactions that ripple across the universe. Will you be the first to achieve Cosmic Singularity?*

---

## **THE CORE EXPERIENCE**

In Bubble Singularity, you'll create exciting chain reactions by strategically placing and moving bubbles across the universe. As your bubbles pop and cascade across space, you'll earn points and special abilities. The most satisfying moments come when you trigger massive chain reactions that earn you Singularity Point markers and propel you toward victory!

**Your goal is to be the first to either:**
* Collect 5 Singularity Point markers by creating large chain reactions
* Or score the most points if the bubble bag is emptied

---

## **COMPONENTS**

* 16 Space Cards (each with 2-4 arrows pointing orthogonally)
* 60 Bubble Tokens (15 each in red, green, blue, and yellow)
* 4 Player Tokens ("Mari" explorers)
* 4 Singularity Nodes
* 12 Singularity Point Markers
* 12 Cosmic Ability Cards (3 categories with 4 cards each)
* 1 Cloth Bag

---

## **SETUP**

1. Arrange the 16 Space Cards in a 4×4 grid
2. Players place their Mari on the middle card of any outer edge (no two players can start on the same side)
3. Place the 4 Singularity Nodes in a diamond pattern (see diagram)
4. Place 1 bubble of each player's color at each Singularity Node on their opposite direction
5. Each player:
   * Takes 1 Mari (player token)
   * Randomly draws 5 Bubble Tokens from the bag
   * Draws 2 Ability cards from the ability decks, selects one as their starting ability, and returns the other to the deck
6. The player with the most colorful outfit goes first, play proceeds clockwise

*Note: In a 2-player game, place a neutral bubble on each empty outer edge space to create more interaction points.*

---

## **YOUR TURN**

On your turn, complete these steps in order:

### **1. MOVE YOUR MARI**

* Choose to move 1, 2, or 3 spaces orthogonally (not diagonally).
* Place 1 of your Bubble Tokens on each space you move through, including your destination.
* You cannot move through or end on a space with another player.

**MOVEMENT TIP:** Consider both where you want to place bubbles and which action you want to perform when choosing your movement path.

### **2. CHOOSE ONE ACTION**

Based on where your Mari ended its movement, choose ONE:

#### **ROTATE & PUSH**
* Rotate your current Space Card 90° in either direction
* Then push ALL bubbles on this space following the arrows
* Each arrow carries exactly one bubble (distribute as evenly as possible)

**OR**

#### **GRAVITY PULL**
* Choose ONE adjacent Space Card
* Pull ALL bubbles from that space to your current space
* If this creates a group of 3+ bubbles, a Bubble Pop occurs

**STRATEGY TIP:** Rotate & Push is useful for triggering chain reactions across the board, while Gravity Pull is excellent for gathering bubbles to create pops on your current space.

---

## **BUBBLE POP**

When 3 or more Bubble Tokens occupy the same space, a Bubble Pop occurs automatically:

1. **Count the Arrows**: First, note how many arrows are on the Space Card where the pop occurs.
2. **Move Bubbles**: One bubble moves along each arrow to adjacent spaces. 
3. **Collect Excess**: The player who triggered the pop collects any remaining bubbles.

**EXAMPLE:**

```
[Space Card with 2 arrows (North and East) contains 5 bubbles]

BEFORE POP:
- Space Card has 2 arrows (pointing North and East)
- Space contains 5 bubbles (3 blue, 2 red)

DURING POP:
- 1 blue bubble moves North along first arrow
- 1 red bubble moves East along second arrow
- Player collects the 3 remaining bubbles (2 blue, 1 red)
```

**IMPORTANT:** If there are more arrows than bubbles, move bubbles along arrows in clockwise order starting from the north arrow until all bubbles are moved. If there are more bubbles than arrows, the active player chooses which bubbles move along which arrows.

---

## **CHAIN REACTIONS**

When a Bubble Pop causes bubbles to move to spaces where they create new groups of 3+ bubbles, a Chain Reaction occurs. This chain continues until no more pops are possible.

**CHAIN REACTION SCORING:**
* 1-chain (single pop): 1 point
* 2-chain (pop causes another pop): 3 points
* 3-chain (two consecutive pops cause a third): 6 points
* 4+ chain (three or more consecutive pops): 10 points + 1 Singularity Point marker

**EXAMPLE OF A 3-CHAIN REACTION:**

```
1. You trigger a pop on Space A containing 4 bubbles.
   - 2 bubbles move along arrows to Spaces B and C
   - You collect the 2 excess bubbles

2. The bubble that moved to Space B creates a group of 3 bubbles there.
   - This triggers a second pop!
   - Bubbles move along arrows, with one going to Space D

3. The bubble that moved to Space D creates a group of 3 bubbles there.
   - This triggers a third pop!
   - No further pops occur, ending the chain

RESULT: You've created a 3-chain reaction worth 6 points!
```

**IMPORTANT:** The player who initiated the first pop scores points for the entire chain reaction, even if it includes bubbles placed by other players.

---

## **SINGULARITY NODES**

These special locations provide additional benefits:

When a Bubble Pop occurs on a Singularity Node:
* Draw 2 ability cards from the decks, select one, discard the other.
* Increase the total chain reaction count by 1 (e.g., a 2-chain scores as a 3-chain for 6 points)

*Note: You can only have one ability card from each category. If you acquire a second card from the same category, you must choose which to keep.*

---

## **ABILITY CARDS**

Ability cards come in 3 categories with 4 cards each:

### **Bubble Mastery (Movement)**
* **Quantum Drift:** Your Mari can move diagonally as well as orthogonally
* **Wormhole Travel:** Your Mari may move from one edge directly to the opposite edge
* **Bubble Resonance:** Place an additional bubble of your color when placing next to your existing bubbles
* **Efficient Explorer:** When moving, choose to place 1 fewer bubble but move 1 additional space

### **Chain Dynamics (Reactions)**
* **Bubble Fusion:** Your color bubbles only need 2 (instead of 3) to trigger a pop
* **Cascade Control:** When triggering a pop, bubbles of your color can move along twice in one arrow
* **Energy Harvest:** Collect 1 bubble from the bag every time a chain reaction above length 2+ occurs
* **Reaction Amplifier:** Increase chain reaction length by 1 when scoring

### **Cosmic Influence (Special)**
* **Space Folder:** Once per turn, rotate any space card 90 degrees (not just your current space)
* **Singularity Attractor:** Once per turn, move 1 node singularity two spaces toward your current space
* **Node Affinity:** Chain reactions worth +2 points when adjacent to Singularity Nodes
* **Bubble Director:** Once per turn, you may move 1 bubble of your color to any adjacent space

---

## **EXAMPLE OF PLAY**

**Player 1 (Blue)** starts with the "Quantum Drift" ability from Bubble Mastery.

1. **MOVE:** They move diagonally 2 spaces toward a Singularity Node, placing a blue bubble on their destination space.
2. **ACTION:** They choose Rotate & Push on their space, which has 2 bubbles (their blue and a yellow placed earlier). They rotate the space 90° clockwise and push both bubbles along arrows.
3. **CHAIN REACTION:** The blue bubble joins 2 other blue bubbles on the next space, causing a pop! This space has 3 arrows, so bubbles move in those directions, with Player 1 collecting the excess bubble.
4. **SCORING:** This was a single chain reaction, so Player 1 scores 1 point.

**Player 2 (Green)** has the "Bubble Fusion" ability from Chain Dynamics.

1. **MOVE:** They move 2 spaces orthogonally, placing green bubbles on each space.
2. **ACTION:** They choose Gravity Pull, pulling a red bubble from an adjacent space to their current space which already has 2 green bubbles.
3. **BUBBLE FUSION:** Since they only need 2 green bubbles for a pop (rather than 3), the 2 green bubbles and 1 red bubble pop!
4. **CHAIN REACTION:** This triggers a chain reaction that continues for 3 pops total.
5. **SCORING:** For a 3-chain reaction, Player 2 scores 6 points.

---

## **STRATEGY TIPS FOR NEW PLAYERS**

* **First Turns:** Move toward Singularity Nodes to acquire abilities and trigger chain reactions
* **Plan Ahead:** Think about where bubbles will go after a pop to set up future chain reactions
* **Watch Your Supply:** Having more bubbles gives you more options, so collect extras when possible
* **Position Strategically:** End your turn where you can take advantage of the action you want next turn
* **Target Singularity Nodes:** Pops on Nodes give you abilities and increased scores
* **Bubble Ownership:** Pay attention to bubble colors - while any bubbles can pop together, collecting your color is advantageous

---

## **GAME END**

The game ends immediately when:

1. A player collects their 5th Singularity Point marker (automatic win)
2. The Bubble Token bag is empty

If the game ends due to an empty bubble bag, the player with the most Singularity Point markers wins. In case of a tie, the player with the most points from chain reactions wins.

## **ADVANCED GAME MODULES**

Once you've mastered the base game, these advanced modules add new depth and strategic options. You can add one module at a time or combine them for experienced players.

### **Module 1: Space Station Network**

**Setup Changes:**
* Replace 4 corner Space Cards with Space Station cards
* Each player receives 1 Space Station Control token
* Increase starting bubbles to 6 per player

**Space Station Cards:**

Each Space Station offers three benefits:
* **Passive Effect:** Always active for anyone near the station
* **Active Effect:** Available when you end your turn at the station
* **Controller Bonus:** Special power for the player who controls the station

1. **Research Station**
   * **Passive:** Chain reactions started adjacent to this station get +1 length
   * **Active:** When you end your turn here, draw 3 bubbles and keep 2
   * **Controller:** When you end your turn here, look at all bubbles in the bag and take 3 of your choice

2. **Transit Station**
   * **Passive:** Movement adjacent to this station costs 0 bubbles
   * **Active:** When you end your turn here, you may teleport to any space on the board
   * **Controller:** When you end your turn here, move any bubble to any space on the board

3. **Energy Station**
   * **Passive:** You need only 2 bubbles (any color) to trigger a pop adjacent to this station
   * **Active:** When you end your turn here, convert up to 3 bubbles on adjacent spaces to your color
   * **Controller:** When you end your turn here, trigger a bubble pop with just 1 bubble of your color

4. **Defense Station**
   * **Passive:** Your bubbles adjacent to this station cannot be moved by other players' actions
   * **Active:** When you end your turn here, place 2 bubbles on any spaces on the board
   * **Controller:** When you end your turn here, block another player's Action (they must choose a different action)

**Station Control:**
* When a player triggers a chain reaction of length 3+ that includes a Space Station, they place their Control token on it
* Controlling multiple stations provides bonus points at game end:
  * 2 stations = 5 points
  * 3 stations = 12 points
  * 4 stations = 20 points

### **Module 2: 5×5 Grid Expansion**

**Setup Changes:**
* Expand to a 5×5 grid (25 Space Cards total)
* Include the Station Space Cards
* Place the Universe Space Card in the center
* Position the 4 Singularity Nodes diagonally around the center
* Add 4 Space Station cards at the corners of the grid
* Increase starting bubbles to 7 per player

**Universe Space Card:**
* This special central card can use ANY Active Effect of Space Station Cards
* It is treated as both a Singularity Node AND a Space Station
* Chain reactions that include the Universe Space Card award 1 additional Singularity Point marker

**Special Card Effects:**
When playing with the 5×5 grid, add these special cards for more dynamic gameplay:

1. **Flux Cards (4)** 
   * **Effect:** When a chain reaction passes through these spaces, the card rotates 90° clockwise
   * **Strategy:** Use these cards to change the direction of future bubble movement

2. **Unstable Cards (4)**
   * **Effect:** After any pop on these spaces, swap this card with any adjacent card
   * **Strategy:** These cards can dramatically reshape the board, creating new opportunities

3. **Expansion Cards (4)**
   * **Effect:** When a chain reaction passes through these spaces, bubbles move 2 spaces instead of 1
   * **Strategy:** Use these to create longer chains or reach distant locations faster

**Balance Adjustments:**
* Chain reaction length requirements increase by 1 (5+ chain needed for a Singularity Point marker)
* Maximum movement increases to 4 spaces
* Players start with all 3 basic abilities (one from each category)
* Game ends at 7 Singularity Point markers instead of 5

**EXAMPLE OF PLAY (Advanced Game):**

```
Player 1 controls the Energy Station and has a Bubble Fusion ability:

1. MOVE: They move 2 spaces to reach the Energy Station, placing bubbles along the way
2. ACTION: They use the station's Active Effect to convert 3 nearby red bubbles to their blue color
3. CONTROLLER BONUS: They use their controller bonus to trigger a pop with just 1 blue bubble
4. CHAIN REACTION: This creates a 4-chain reaction that passes through the Universe Space Card
5. SCORING: They score 10 points for the chain, PLUS 2 Singularity Point markers (1 for the chain, 1 for including the Universe Space Card)
```
