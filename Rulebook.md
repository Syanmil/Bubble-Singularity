# **BUBBLE SINGULARITY**

## **A Strategic Space Adventure for 2-4 Players**

*Legend tells of cosmic bubbles that appear only during rare Singularity events. Brave space explorers known as Mari now race to harness these bubbles' power, creating chain reactions that ripple across the universe.*

## **OBJECTIVE**

Find and trigger powerful bubble chain reactions! The game ends when one player collects 5 Singularity Point markers (finishing the current round so all players have the same number of turns) or when the bubble bag is empty. The player with the most total points wins.

---

## **COMPONENTS**

![Component overview diagram showing all game pieces]

* 16 Space Cards (with 2-4 directional arrows each)
* 60 Bubble Tokens (15 each in red, green, blue, and yellow)
* 4 Mari Explorer Tokens (player pieces)
* 4 Singularity Node Tokens
* 12 Singularity Point Markers
* 12 Cosmic Ability Cards (3 categories with 4 cards each)
* 1 Cloth Bag

---

## **SETUP**

![Setup diagram showing the full game board with all pieces in starting positions]

1. Arrange the 16 Space Cards in a 4×4 grid as shown.
2. Place the 4 Singularity Nodes in a diamond pattern on the board (see diagram).
3. Place 1 bubble of each player's color at each Singularity Node opposite their starting position.
4. Each player:
   * Takes 1 Mari explorer token in their chosen color
   * Randomly draws 5 Bubble Tokens from the bag
   * Draws 2 Ability cards from the ability decks, selects one as their starting ability, and returns the other
5. Players place their Mari on the middle card of any outer edge (no two players can start on the same side).
6. The player with the most colorful outfit goes first, play proceeds clockwise.

**WHEN PLAYING WITH 2 PLAYERS:**
Place a neutral bubble on each empty outer edge space to create more interaction points.

**WHEN PLAYING WITH BEGINNERS:**
Skip ability cards and use the simplified setup shown in the diagram. Each player starts with 3 bubbles of their color.

![Beginner setup diagram showing simplified starting position]

---

## **GAMEPLAY**

Players take turns in clockwise order until the game ends. On your turn, you must complete these two phases in order:

### **PHASE 1: MOVE YOUR MARI**

![Movement example diagram showing Mari movement and bubble placement]

* Move your Mari 1-3 spaces orthogonally (not diagonally).
* Place 1 of your Bubble Tokens on each space you move through, including your destination.
* You cannot move through or end on a space with another player.

**EXAMPLE:**
```
Blue player moves 3 spaces from the edge toward a Singularity Node.
They place a blue bubble on each space they move through, including their destination.
They now have 3 fewer bubbles in their supply.
```

### **PHASE 2: CHOOSE ONE ACTION**

Based on where your Mari ended its movement, choose exactly ONE of these actions:

#### **ACTION A: ROTATE & PUSH**

![Rotate & Push diagram showing before and after positions]

1. Rotate your current Space Card 90° in either direction
2. Push ALL bubbles on this space along the arrows
3. Each arrow carries exactly one bubble (distribute evenly)

**EXAMPLE:**
```
The Space Card has 2 arrows and 5 bubbles.
After rotating the card clockwise, you push bubbles along arrows.
Arrow 1 carries 1 bubble north, Arrow 2 carries 1 bubble east.
You distribute the remaining 3 bubbles as evenly as possible.
```

#### **ACTION B: GRAVITY PULL**

![Gravity Pull diagram showing bubble movement]

1. Choose ONE adjacent Space Card
2. Pull ALL bubbles from that space to your current space
3. If this creates a group of 3+ bubbles, a Bubble Pop occurs

**EXAMPLE:**
```
Your space has 2 green bubbles. 
The adjacent space has 1 yellow bubble.
You pull the yellow bubble to your space.
You now have 3 bubbles together (2 green, 1 yellow).
This triggers a Bubble Pop!
```

---

## **BUBBLE POP**

When 3 or more Bubble Tokens occupy the same space, a Bubble Pop occurs automatically. This is the core mechanism of the game!

![Bubble Pop diagram showing before, during, and after states]

### **RESOLVING A BUBBLE POP:**

1. **Count the Arrows**: Note how many arrows are on the Space Card where the pop occurs.
2. **Move Bubbles**: One bubble moves along each arrow to adjacent spaces. 
3. **Collect Excess**: The player who triggered the pop collects any remaining bubbles.

**EXAMPLE: BUBBLE POP ON A SPACE WITH 2 ARROWS**

![Detailed Bubble Pop example with step-by-step sequence]

```
BEFORE:
- Space Card has 2 arrows (pointing North and East)
- Space contains 5 bubbles (3 blue, 2 red)

DURING:
- 1 blue bubble moves North along first arrow
- 1 red bubble moves East along second arrow

AFTER:
- Player collects the 3 remaining bubbles (2 blue, 1 red)
- These collected bubbles return to their supply
```

**BUBBLE DISTRIBUTION RULES:**

* **If bubbles = arrows**: Each arrow carries exactly one bubble.
* **If bubbles < arrows**: Move bubbles along arrows in clockwise order starting from the north.
* **If bubbles > arrows**: Each arrow carries one bubble, and the active player collects all excess bubbles.
* **Choosing bubbles**: The active player decides which bubbles move along which arrows.

## **CHAIN REACTIONS**

The most exciting part of Bubble Singularity happens when one Bubble Pop triggers another, creating a chain reaction! These cascading reactions are how you score points and earn Singularity Point markers.

![Chain Reaction diagram showing multiple connected pops]

### **HOW CHAIN REACTIONS WORK:**

When bubbles from a pop move to new spaces and create groups of 3+ bubbles, those new groups also pop, continuing the chain. This repeats until no more pops are possible.

### **CHAIN REACTION SCORING:**

![Chain Reaction scoring chart with visual examples]

* **1-chain** (single pop): **1 point**
* **2-chain** (pop causes another pop): **3 points**
* **3-chain** (two consecutive pops cause a third): **6 points**
* **4+ chain** (three or more consecutive pops): **10 points + 1 Singularity Point marker**

### **EXAMPLE OF A 3-CHAIN REACTION:**

![Detailed 3-chain example with step-by-step sequence]

```
STEP 1:
- You trigger a pop on Space A containing 4 bubbles
- 2 bubbles move along arrows to Spaces B and C
- You collect the 2 excess bubbles

STEP 2:
- The bubble that moved to Space B joins 2 bubbles already there
- This creates a group of 3, triggering a second pop!
- Bubbles move along arrows, with one going to Space D

STEP 3:
- The bubble that moved to Space D joins 2 bubbles already there
- This creates a group of 3, triggering a third pop!
- No further pops occur, ending the chain

RESULT: You've created a 3-chain reaction worth 6 points!
```

**IMPORTANT:** The player who initiated the first pop scores points for the entire chain reaction, even if it includes bubbles placed by other players.

**SINGULARITY POINT MARKERS:**
When you create a chain reaction of 4 or more pops, you immediately earn 1 Singularity Point marker. Place this marker in front of you - these are the key to victory!

---

## **SPECIAL LOCATIONS**

### **SINGULARITY NODES**

![Singularity Node diagram with example]

These special locations marked with a distinctive symbol provide powerful benefits when activated:

**WHEN A BUBBLE POP OCCURS ON A SINGULARITY NODE:**
* Draw 2 ability cards from the decks, select one, and discard the other.
* Increase the total chain reaction count by 1 (e.g., a 2-chain scores as a 3-chain for 6 points)

**EXAMPLE:**
```
You trigger a 2-chain reaction that includes a pop on a Singularity Node.
This counts as a 3-chain reaction (worth 6 points instead of 3).
You also draw 2 ability cards and keep 1 of them.
```

---

## **COSMIC ABILITY CARDS**

![Ability Card diagram showing card layout and types]

Ability cards provide unique powers that enhance your strategy. They are organized into 3 categories, each with 4 cards:

### **CATEGORY 1: BUBBLE MASTERY (MOVEMENT)**

Each card improves how your Mari moves and places bubbles.

* **Quantum Drift:** Your Mari can move diagonally as well as orthogonally
* **Wormhole Travel:** Your Mari may move from one edge directly to the opposite edge
* **Bubble Resonance:** Place an additional bubble of your color when placing next to your existing bubbles
* **Efficient Explorer:** When moving, choose to place 1 fewer bubble but move 1 additional space

### **CATEGORY 2: CHAIN DYNAMICS (REACTIONS)**

Each card enhances how your bubble pops and chain reactions work.

* **Bubble Fusion:** Your color bubbles only need 2 (instead of 3) to trigger a pop
* **Cascade Control:** When triggering a pop, bubbles of your color can move along twice in one arrow
* **Energy Harvest:** Collect 1 bubble from the bag every time a chain reaction above length 2+ occurs
* **Reaction Amplifier:** Increase chain reaction length by 1 when scoring

### **CATEGORY 3: COSMIC INFLUENCE (SPECIAL)**

Each card grants a unique special ability.

* **Space Folder:** Once per turn, rotate any space card 90 degrees (not just your current space)
* **Singularity Attractor:** Once per turn, move 1 node singularity two spaces toward your current space
* **Node Affinity:** Chain reactions worth +2 points when adjacent to Singularity Nodes
* **Bubble Director:** Once per turn, you may move 1 bubble of your color to any adjacent space

**IMPORTANT:** You can have only one ability card from each category. If you acquire a second card from the same category, you must choose which to keep.

## **EXAMPLE OF COMPLETE TURNS**

![Example of Play diagram showing full board state]

### **EXAMPLE TURN 1: USING QUANTUM DRIFT**

**Player 1 (Blue)** has the "Quantum Drift" ability from Bubble Mastery.

![Blue player turn sequence diagram]

1. **MOVE:** They move diagonally 2 spaces toward a Singularity Node (diagonal movement allowed by their ability).
   * They place a blue bubble on each space they move through, including the destination.

2. **ACTION:** They choose Rotate & Push on their space, which has 2 bubbles (their blue and a yellow placed earlier).
   * They rotate the space 90° clockwise.
   * They push both bubbles along arrows.

3. **CHAIN REACTION:** The blue bubble joins 2 other blue bubbles on the next space, causing a pop!
   * This space has 3 arrows, so bubbles move in those directions.
   * Player 1 collects the excess bubble.

4. **SCORING:** This was a single chain reaction, so Player 1 scores 1 point.

### **EXAMPLE TURN 2: USING BUBBLE FUSION**

**Player 2 (Green)** has the "Bubble Fusion" ability from Chain Dynamics.

![Green player turn sequence diagram]

1. **MOVE:** They move 2 spaces orthogonally toward a cluster of bubbles.
   * They place green bubbles on each space they move through.

2. **ACTION:** They choose Gravity Pull, pulling a red bubble from an adjacent space.
   * Their current space already has 2 green bubbles.
   * Their "Bubble Fusion" ability allows green bubbles to pop with only 2 (not 3).
   * The 2 green bubbles and 1 red bubble pop!

3. **CHAIN REACTION:** This triggers a cascade of pops:
   * First pop: Bubbles move to adjacent spaces
   * Second pop: One bubble creates another group of 3
   * Third pop: Another group of 3 forms and pops

4. **SCORING:** For a 3-chain reaction, Player 2 scores 6 points.

## **STRATEGY GUIDE FOR NEW EXPLORERS**

![Strategy diagram showing key board positions and opportunities]

### **FIRST MOVES:**
* Move toward Singularity Nodes early to acquire powerful abilities
* Create small bubble clusters that are one bubble away from popping
* Watch what colors other players are collecting

### **MID-GAME TACTICS:**
* Plan chain reactions by analyzing arrow directions
* Try to end your turn where you'll have good action options next turn
* Collect excess bubbles whenever possible to maintain your supply
* Target Singularity Nodes for enhanced scoring and new abilities

### **ADVANCED STRATEGIES:**
* Set up multi-step chain reactions that opponents can't easily disrupt
* Use your abilities in combination for maximum effect
* Watch the bubble bag - if it's getting low, focus on scoring quickly
* Block opponents from reaching Singularity Nodes when possible

---

## **GAME END & SCORING**

![Game end scoring diagram]

The game ends in one of these situations:

1. **A player collects their 5th Singularity Point marker**
   * When this happens, complete the current round so all players have had the same number of turns 
   * The player with the most points wins (not necessarily the player who triggered the end)

2. **The Bubble Token bag is empty**
   * The game ends immediately when a player tries to draw a bubble and cannot

### **FINAL SCORING**

When the game ends, points are calculated as follows:
* Points from chain reactions throughout the game
* 1 point for each bubble remaining in your supply
* Most Singularity Point markers (used as tiebreaker)

### **FINAL SCORING EXAMPLE:**

![Scoring example with multiple players]

```
PLAYER 1 (BLUE):
- 3 Singularity Point markers
- 17 points from chain reactions
- 6 remaining bubbles (6 points)
- TOTAL: 23 POINTS

PLAYER 2 (GREEN):
- 5 Singularity Point markers (triggered game end)
- 12 points from chain reactions
- 2 remaining bubbles (2 points)
- TOTAL: 14 POINTS

PLAYER 3 (RED):
- 2 Singularity Point markers
- 23 points from chain reactions
- 3 remaining bubbles (3 points)
- TOTAL: 26 POINTS

RESULT: Player 3 wins with 26 points, despite not triggering the game end!
```

## **ADVANCED GAME MODULES**

Once you've mastered the base game, these advanced modules add new depth and strategic options. You can add one module at a time or combine them for experienced players.

### **Module 1: Space Station Network**

**Setup Changes:**
* Replace 4 corner Space Cards with Space Station cards
* Each player receives 1 Space Station Control token
* Increase starting bubbles to 6 per player

**Space Station Cards:**

Each Space Station offers three benefits:
* **Passive Effect:** Always active for anyone near the station
* **Active Effect:** Available when you end your turn at the station
* **Controller Bonus:** Special power for the player who controls the station

1. **Research Station**
   * **Passive:** Chain reactions started adjacent to this station get +1 length
   * **Active:** When you end your turn here, draw 3 bubbles and keep 2
   * **Controller:** When you end your turn here, look at all bubbles in the bag and take 3 of your choice

2. **Transit Station**
   * **Passive:** Movement adjacent to this station costs 0 bubbles
   * **Active:** When you end your turn here, you may teleport to any space on the board
   * **Controller:** When you end your turn here, move any bubble to any space on the board

3. **Energy Station**
   * **Passive:** You need only 2 bubbles (any color) to trigger a pop adjacent to this station
   * **Active:** When you end your turn here, convert up to 3 bubbles on adjacent spaces to your color
   * **Controller:** When you end your turn here, trigger a bubble pop with just 1 bubble of your color

4. **Defense Station**
   * **Passive:** Your bubbles adjacent to this station cannot be moved by other players' actions
   * **Active:** When you end your turn here, place 2 bubbles on any spaces on the board
   * **Controller:** When you end your turn here, block another player's Action (they must choose a different action)

**Station Control:**
* When a player triggers a chain reaction of length 3+ that includes a Space Station, they place their Control token on it
* Controlling multiple stations provides bonus points at game end:
  * 2 stations = 5 points
  * 3 stations = 12 points
  * 4 stations = 20 points

### **Module 2: 5×5 Grid Expansion**

**Setup Changes:**
* Expand to a 5×5 grid (25 Space Cards total)
* Include the Station Space Cards
* Place the Universe Space Card in the center
* Position the 4 Singularity Nodes diagonally around the center
* Add 4 Space Station cards at the corners of the grid
* Increase starting bubbles to 7 per player

**Universe Space Card:**
* This special central card can use ANY trigger ability (Rotate & Push OR Gravity Pull)
* It is treated as both a Singularity Node AND a Space Station
* Chain reactions that include the Universe Space Card award 1 additional Singularity Point marker

**Special Card Effects:**
When playing with the 5×5 grid, add these special cards for more dynamic gameplay:

1. **Flux Cards (4)** 
   * **Effect:** When a chain reaction passes through these spaces, the card rotates 90° clockwise
   * **Strategy:** Use these cards to change the direction of future bubble movement

2. **Unstable Cards (4)**
   * **Effect:** After any pop on these spaces, swap this card with any adjacent card
   * **Strategy:** These cards can dramatically reshape the board, creating new opportunities

3. **Expansion Cards (4)**
   * **Effect:** When a chain reaction passes through these spaces, bubbles move 2 spaces instead of 1
   * **Strategy:** Use these to create longer chains or reach distant locations faster

**Balance Adjustments:**
* Chain reaction length requirements increase by 1 (5+ chain needed for a Singularity Point marker)
* Maximum movement increases to 4 spaces
* Players start with all 3 basic abilities (one from each category)
* Game ends at 7 Singularity Point markers instead of 5

**EXAMPLE OF PLAY (Advanced Game):**

```
Player 1 controls the Energy Station and has a Bubble Fusion ability:

1. MOVE: They move 2 spaces to reach the Energy Station, placing bubbles along the way
2. ACTION: They use the station's Active Effect to convert 3 nearby red bubbles to their blue color
3. CONTROLLER BONUS: They use their controller bonus to trigger a pop with just 1 blue bubble
4. CHAIN REACTION: This creates a 4-chain reaction that passes through the Universe Space Card
5. SCORING: They score 10 points for the chain, PLUS 2 Singularity Point markers (1 for the chain, 1 for including the Universe Space Card)
```

## **APPENDIX: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS**

![FAQ section header graphic]

### **MOVEMENT QUESTIONS**

**Q: Can I move fewer than 3 spaces if I want to?**
A: Yes! You can choose to move 1, 2, or 3 spaces on your turn.

**Q: Do I have to place bubbles on every space I move through?**
A: Yes. Place 1 bubble on each space you move through, including your destination.

**Q: What if I don't have enough bubbles to place on all spaces I want to move through?**
A: You cannot move more spaces than the number of bubbles you have available to place.

**Q: Can ability cards allow me to move more than 3 spaces?**
A: Only if the ability card specifically says so. The "Efficient Explorer" ability allows movement of up to 4 spaces while placing 3 bubbles.

### **BUBBLE POP QUESTIONS**

**Q: Who chooses which bubbles move along which arrows during a pop?**
A: The player who triggered the pop decides which bubbles move along which arrows.

**Q: What happens if a Bubble Pop would send bubbles off the grid?**
A: Bubbles cannot move off the grid. If an arrow points off the grid, no bubble moves in that direction. It counts as one of the arrows for determining excess bubbles.

**Q: Can a chain reaction include the same space multiple times?**
A: Yes. If bubbles return to a space that has already popped, it can pop again if 3+ bubbles accumulate there.

### **ABILITY CARD QUESTIONS**

**Q: Can I have multiple ability cards from the same category?**
A: No. You may only have one ability card from each category (Movement, Reactions, and Special).

**Q: What happens if I draw an ability in a category I already have?**
A: You must either keep your current ability card or replace it with the new one. Return the unchosen card to the bottom of its deck.

**Q: Do ability card effects stack?**
A: Yes. Your abilities from different categories can be combined for powerful combos.

### **SPACE STATION QUESTIONS (ADVANCED GAME)**

**Q: Can multiple players benefit from a Space Station's Passive Effect at the same time?**
A: Yes. The Passive Effect of a Space Station is available to all players regardless of who controls it.

**Q: Can I use a Space Station's Active Effect if another player controls it?**
A: Yes. Any player who ends their turn on a Space Station can use its Active Effect regardless of who controls it.

**Q: How do I gain control of a Space Station?**
A: Trigger a chain reaction of length 3+ that includes the Space Station. This means a bubble pop must occur on the Space Station card itself.

### **GAME END QUESTIONS**

**Q: What happens when someone collects their 5th Singularity Point marker?**
A: The current round continues until all players have had the same number of turns. Then the game ends and final scoring occurs.

**Q: How are final points calculated?**
A: Add together all points earned from chain reactions during the game, plus 1 point for each bubble remaining in your supply at game end.

**Q: What if there's a tie in final points?**
A: The player with the most Singularity Point markers wins the tie. If still tied, the player with the most chain reaction points wins.

## **GAME DESIGN NOTES**

Bubble Singularity was designed by Syanmil Izhharuddin over a period of two years. The core concept was inspired by classic bubble-popping puzzle games but reimagined as a tactile board game experience. The key design goals were:

1. **Creating satisfying chain reactions** that build in excitement
2. **Balancing luck and strategy** so players of different skill levels can enjoy the game
3. **Encouraging player interaction** without direct conflict
4. **Ensuring every turn feels meaningful** and moves the game forward
