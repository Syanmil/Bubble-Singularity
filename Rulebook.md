# **BUBBLE SINGULARITY**

## **A Strategic Space Adventure for 2-4 Players**

*In the vast expanse of space, brave explorers race to manipulate cosmic bubbles, creating powerful chain reactions that ripple across the universe. Will you be the first to achieve Cosmic Singularity?*

---

## **THE CORE EXPERIENCE**

In Bubble Singularity, you'll create exciting chain reactions by strategically placing and moving bubbles across the universe. As your bubbles pop and cascade across space, you'll earn points and special abilities. The most satisfying moments come when you trigger massive chain reactions that earn you Singularity Point markers and propel you toward victory!

**Your goal is to be the first to either:**
* Collect 5 Singularity Point markers by creating large chain reactions
* Or score the most points if the bubble bag is emptied

---

## **COMPONENTS**

* 16 Space Cards (each with 2-4 arrows pointing orthogonally)
* 60 Bubble Tokens (15 each in red, green, blue, and yellow)
* 4 Player Tokens ("Mari" explorers)
* 4 Singularity Nodes
* 12 Singularity Point Markers
* 12 Cosmic Ability Cards (3 categories with 4 cards each)
* 1 Cloth Bag

---

## **SETUP**

1. Arrange the 16 Space Cards in a 4×4 grid
2. Players place their Mari on the middle card of any outer edge (no two players can start on the same side)
3. Place the 4 Singularity Nodes in a diamond pattern (see diagram)
4. Place 1 bubble of each player's color at each Singularity Node on their opposite direction
5. Each player:
   * Takes 1 Mari (player token)
   * Randomly draws 5 Bubble Tokens from the bag
   * Draws 2 Ability cards from the ability decks, selects one as their starting ability, and returns the other to the deck
6. The player with the most colorful outfit goes first, play proceeds clockwise

*Note: In a 2-player game, place a neutral bubble on each empty outer edge space to create more interaction points.*

---

## **GAMEPLAY**

Players take turns in clockwise order. On your turn, complete these two phases:

### **1. MOVE & PLACE**

* Move your Mari 1-3 spaces orthogonally (not diagonally, unless you have an ability that allows it)
* Place 1 Bubble Token from your supply on each space you move through (including your destination space, but not your starting space)
* You cannot move through or end on a space containing another player

### **2. SPACE ACTION**

After moving, choose ONE of these actions based on where your Mari ended its movement:

#### **Rotate & Push**
* Rotate the Space Card where your Mari stands 90 degrees in either direction
* Push all Bubbles on that space in the direction of the arrows
* Each arrow must have the same number of bubbles (distributed as evenly as possible)

#### **Gravity Pull**
* Choose one direction (orthogonally adjacent)
* Pull all Bubble(s) from that adjacent Space Card to your current Space Card

*If a Space Card has a special icon (Singularity Node), it provides additional benefits when activated.*

### **BUBBLE POP (if triggered)**

When 3 or more Bubble Tokens of any color occupy the same space, a Bubble Pop occurs automatically:

1. Each arrow on the Space Card allows one bubble to move in that direction
2. You collect any excess bubbles (beyond the number of arrows)
3. If bubbles move to a space that creates another group of 3+ bubbles, a Chain Reaction occurs

**EXAMPLE:** *A space with 2 arrows (north and east) containing 5 bubbles:*
* *1 bubble moves north*
* *1 bubble moves east*
* *You collect the remaining 3 bubbles*

---

## **CHAIN REACTIONS**

If bubbles are pushed into a space that creates another group of 3+ bubbles, a Chain Reaction occurs. This continues until no more pops are possible.

**Chain Reaction Scoring:**
* 1-chain: 1 point
* 2-chain: 3 points
* 3-chain: 6 points
* 4+ chain: 10 points

**Chain Reaction Bonuses:**
* 4+ chain reaction: Place a Singularity Point marker on your Player Card

**IMPORTANT:** The player who initiates a chain reaction is the one who scores points, even if the chain includes bubbles placed by other players.

---

## **SINGULARITY NODES**

These special locations provide additional benefits:

When a Bubble Pop occurs on a Singularity Node:
* Draw 2 ability card from the decks, select one, discard the other.
* Increase the total chain reaction count by 1 (e.g., a 2-chain scores as a 3-chain for 6 points)

*Note: You can only have one ability card from each category. If you acquire a second card from the same category, you must choose which to keep.*

---

## **ABILITY CARDS**

Ability cards come in 3 categories with 4 cards each:

### **Bubble Mastery (Movement)**
* **Quantum Drift:** Your Mari can move diagonally as well as orthogonally
* **Wormhole Travel:** Your Mari may move from one edge directly to the opposite edge
* **Bubble Resonance:** Place an additional bubble of your color when placing next to your existing bubbles
* **Efficient Explorer:** When moving, choose to place 1 fewer bubble but move 1 additional space

### **Chain Dynamics (Reactions)**
* **Bubble Fusion:** Your color bubbles only need 2 (instead of 3) to trigger a pop
* **Cascade Control:** When triggering a pop, bubbles of your color can move along twice in one arrow
* **Energy Harvest:** Collect 1 bubble from the bag every a chain reaction above length 2+
* **Reaction Amplifier:** Increase chain reaction length by 1 when scoring

### **Cosmic Influence (Special)**
* **Space Folder:** Once per turn, rotate any space card 90 degrees (not just your current space)
* **Singularity Attractor:** Once per turn, move 1 node singularity two spaces toward your current space
* **Node Affinity:** Chain reactions worth +2 points when adjacent to Singularity Nodes
* **Bubble Director:** Once per turn, you may move 1 bubble of your color to any adjacent space

---

## **STRATEGY TIPS FOR NEW PLAYERS**

* **First Turns:** Move toward Singularity Nodes to acquire abilities and trigger chain reactions
* **Plan Ahead:** Think about where bubbles will go after a pop to set up future chain reactions
* **Watch Your Supply:** Having more bubbles gives you more options, so collect extras when possible
* **Position Strategically:** End your turn where you can take advantage of the action you want next turn
* **Target Singularity Nodes:** Pops on Nodes give you abilities and increased scores
* **Bubble Ownership:** Pay attention to bubble colors - while any bubbles can pop together, collecting your color is advantageous

---

## **EXAMPLE OF PLAY**

**Player 1 (Blue)** starts with the "Quantum Drift" ability from Bubble Mastery.

1. **MOVE:** They move diagonally 2 spaces toward a Singularity Node, placing a blue bubble on their destination space.
2. **ACTION:** They choose Rotate & Push on their space, which has 2 bubbles (their blue and a yellow placed earlier). They rotate the space 90° clockwise and push both bubbles along arrows.
3. **CHAIN REACTION:** The blue bubble joins 2 other blue bubbles on the next space, causing a pop! This space has 3 arrows, so bubbles move in those directions, with Player 1 collecting the excess bubble.
4. **SCORING:** This was a single chain reaction, so Player 1 scores 1 point.

**Player 2 (Green)** has the "Bubble Fusion" ability from Chain Dynamics.

1. **MOVE:** They move 2 spaces orthogonally, placing green bubbles on each space.
2. **ACTION:** They choose Gravity Pull, pulling a red bubble from an adjacent space to their current space which already has 2 green bubbles.
3. **BUBBLE FUSION:** Since they only need 2 green bubbles for a pop (rather than 3), the 2 green bubbles and 1 red bubble pop!
4. **CHAIN REACTION:** This triggers a chain reaction that continues for 3 pops total.
5. **SCORING:** For a 3-chain reaction, Player 2 scores 6 points.

---

## **GAME END**

The game ends immediately when:

1. A player collects their 5th Singularity Point marker (automatic win)
2. The Bubble Token bag is empty

If the game ends due to an empty bubble bag, the player with the most Singularity Point markers wins. In case of a tie, the player with the most points from chain reactions wins.

## **ADVANCED GAME**

Once you've mastered the base game, try these advanced modules. You can add one module at a time or combine them for experienced players.

### **Module 1: Space Station Network**

**Setup Changes:**
* Replace 4 corner Space Cards with Space Station cards
* Each player receives 1 Space Station Control token
* Increase starting bubbles to 6 per player

**Space Station Cards:**
1. **Research Station**
   * **Passive Effect:** Chain reactions started adjacent to this station get +1 length
   * **Active Effect:** When you end your turn here, draw 3 bubbles and keep 2
   * **Controller Bonus:** When you end your turn here, look at all bubbles in the bag and take 3 of your choice

2. **Transit Station**
   * **Passive Effect:** Movement adjacent to this station costs 0 bubbles
   * **Active Effect:** When you end your turn here, you may teleport to any space on the board
   * **Controller Bonus:** When you end your turn here, move any bubble to any space on the board

3. **Energy Station**
   * **Passive Effect:** You need only 2 bubbles (any color) to trigger a pop adjacent to this station
   * **Active Effect:** When you end your turn here, convert up to 3 bubbles on adjacent spaces to your color
   * **Controller Bonus:** When you end your turn here, trigger a bubble pop with just 1 bubble of your color

4. **Defense Station**
   * **Passive Effect:** Your bubbles adjacent to this station cannot be moved by other players' actions
   * **Active Effect:** When you end your turn here, place 2 bubbles on any spaces on the board
   * **Controller Bonus:** When you end your turn here, block another player's Action (they must choose a different action)

**Station Control:**
* When a player triggers a chain reaction of length 3+ that includes a Space Station, they may place their Control token on it
* If a player already controls that station, they retain control
* Controlling multiple stations provides bonus points at game end:
  * 2 stations = 5 points
  * 3 stations = 12 points
  * 4 stations = 20 points

### **Module 2: 5×5 Grid Expansion**

**Setup Changes:**
* Expand to a 5×5 grid (25 Space Cards total)
* Include the Station Space Cards
* Place the Universe Space Card in the center
* Position the 4 Singularity Nodes in four diagonal around the center
* Add 4 Space Station cards at the corners of the grid
* Increase starting bubbles to 7 per player

**Universe Space Card:**
* This special central card can use ANY trigger ability
* It is treated as both a Singularity Node AND a Space Station
* Chain reactions that include the Universe Space Card award 1 additional Singularity Point marker

**Card Transformation Effects:**
* When playing with the 5×5 grid, add these transformation effects to certain cards:
  1. **Flux Cards (4):** When a chain reaction passes through these spaces, the card rotates 90° clockwise
  2. **Unstable Cards (4):** After any pop on these spaces, swap this card with any adjacent card
  3. **Expansion Cards (4):** When a chain reaction passes through these spaces, the bubble move 2 spaces instead
  
**Balance Adjustments:**
* Chain reaction length requirements increase by 1 (5+ chain needed for a Singularity Point marker)
* Maximum movement increases to 4 spaces
* Players start with all 3 basic abilities (one from each category)
* Game ends at 7 Singularity Point markers instead of 5
