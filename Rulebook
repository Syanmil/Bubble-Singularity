BUBBLE SINGULARITY
A Strategic Space Adventure for 2-4 Players
In the vast expanse of space, brave explorers race to manipulate cosmic bubbles, creating powerful chain reactions that ripple across the universe. Will you be the first to achieve Cosmic Singularity?

THE CORE EXPERIENCE
In Bubble Singularity, you'll create exciting chain reactions by strategically placing and moving bubbles across the universe. As your bubbles pop and cascade across space, you'll earn points and special abilities. The most satisfying moments come when you trigger massive chain reactions that earn you Singularity Point markers and propel you toward victory!
Your goal is to be the first to either:
Collect 5 Singularity Point markers by creating large chain reactions
Acquire 5 different types of ability cards
Or score the most points if other end conditions are met

COMPONENTS
25 Space Cards (each with 2-4 arrows pointing orthogonally)
60 Bubble Tokens (15 each in red, green, blue, and yellow)
4 Player Tokens ("Mari" explorers)
4 Singularity Nodes
12 Singularity Point Markers
27 Cosmic Ability Cards
1 Cloth Bag
![Components Diagram](placeholder for component images)

SETUP
Arrange the 25 Space Cards in a 5Ã—5 grid
Place the Universe Space Card in the center
Place the 4 Singularity Nodes on the diagonal spaces adjacent to the Universe Space Card
Place 1 random Bubble Token on every Rotate Push space card
Each player:
Takes 1 Mari (player token)
Randomly draws 5 Bubble Tokens from the bag
Draws 2 Ability cards, selects one as their starting ability, and returns the other to the deck
Players place their Mari on the middle card of any outer edge (no two players can start on the same side)
Shuffle the remaining Cosmic Ability cards and place 3 cards face-up to form the Cosmic Market

FIRST GAME SIMPLIFIED SETUP
For your first game, we recommend these simplifications:
Remove all Space Station space cards (6)
Remove 3 random Space Cards (except the Universe card)
Remove all Active Ability cards (Bubble Manipulation and Cosmic Control)
Use only the Passive Ability cards (Movement Enhancement, Reaction Enhancement, and Singularity Affinity)
Create Map of 4x4 Grid map
Place 4 Singularity Nodes in center positions (as shown in the diagram)

BASIC GAMEPLAY
You can start playing after reading this section!
Players take turns in clockwise order. On your turn, complete these phases:
1. MOVE
Move your Mari 1-3 spaces orthogonally (not diagonally)
Place 1 Bubble Token from your supply on each space you move through (including your destination space, but not your starting space)
You cannot move through or end on a space containing another player
2. ACTION
After moving, choose ONE of these actions based on where your Mari ended its movement:
Space Warp
May place 1 Bubble Token anywhere on the board
Move your Mari to any space on the board (not necessarily where you placed the bubble)
Gravity Pull
Choose one Space Card with at least one Bubble
Pull all Bubble(s) from one adjacent Space Card to it
Rotate Push
Select any Space Card containing at least one Bubble Token
Rotate that Space Card 90 degrees in either direction
Push all Bubbles on that space in the direction of the arrows
All Arrow must have the same amount of bubble as evenly as possible
Space Station
Activate all ability cards you have, And
Draw 2 Bubble Tokens from the bag
(Maximum hand size is 5 Bubbles; return excess to the bag at end of turn)
3. BUBBLE POP (if triggered)
When 3 or more Bubble Tokens occupy the same space, a Bubble Pop occurs automatically:
Each arrow on the Space Card allows one bubble to move in that direction
You collect any excess bubbles (beyond the number of arrows)
EXAMPLE: A space with 2 arrows (north and east) containing 5 bubbles:
1 bubble moves north
1 bubble moves east
You collect the remaining 3 bubbles
![Bubble Pop Example](placeholder for bubble pop example)

YOUR FIRST TURN - EXAMPLE
Player 1 starts with their Mari on the middle edge space and 5 blue bubbles:
MOVE: They move 2 spaces toward the closest singularity node, placing a blue bubble on the space they move through and their destination space.
ACTION: They end on a normal space and choose Gravity Pull. They pull 2 red bubbles from an adjacent space to their current space.
BUBBLE POP: This creates a group of 3 bubbles, triggering a Bubble Pop. The space has 2 arrows, so 2 bubbles move in those directions, and Player 1 collects the extra bubble. 
Their turn is now complete, and Player 2 begins their turn.
You can now begin playing! Continue reading for more detailed rules.

CHAIN REACTIONS
If bubbles are pushed into a space that creates another group of 3+ bubbles, a Chain Reaction occurs. This continues until no more pops are possible.
Chain Reaction Scoring:
2-chain: Score 2 points
3-chain: Score 4 points
4-chain: Score 7 points
5-chain: Score 11 points
Chain Reaction Bonuses:
4+ chain reaction: Place a Singularity Point marker on your Player Card
EXAMPLE CHAIN REACTION:
You create a Bubble Pop on Space A with 4 bubbles. Two bubbles move along arrows.
One bubble moves to Space B, which now has 3 bubbles, causing another pop.
A bubble from Space B moves to Space C, creating a third pop.
This is a 3-chain reaction, so you score 4 points.

SPECIAL LOCATIONS
Singularity Nodes
When a Bubble Pop occurs on a Singularity Node:
Take an ability card from the display or draw from the deck
Increase the total chain reaction count by 1 (e.g., a 1-chain scores as a 2-chain for 2 points, a 2-chain scores as a 3-chain for 5 points)
Universe Space Card
This special central space can use any trigger ability (Space Warp, Gravity Pull, Rotate Push, or Space Station)
It is also treated as a Singularity Node when a Bubble Pop occurs here

ABILITY CARDS
Ability cards come in 2 types (Passive and Active) with 5 total categories. Important: You can only have 1 card from each category. If you acquire a new card from a category you already have, you must discard the old one.
Passive Abilities (Always Active)
Once acquired, these provide permanent benefits for the rest of the game.
Movement Enhancements ðŸš€
Diagonal Drifter: Your Mari can move diagonally as well as orthogonally
Quantum Phaser: Your Mari may move through spaces containing other players AND gain +1 movement if no other players are adjacent to you
Edge Walker: Your Mari may move from one edge directly to the opposite edge
Bubble Surfer: You dont need to place bubble tokens when moving through spaces that already contain your color bubble
Reaction Enhancements âš¡
Color Popper: You only need 2 bubbles of your color to trigger a pop
Chain Harvester: When you trigger a 3+ chain reaction, collect 2 extra bubbles from the bag
Color Stacker: Your color bubbles can use the same arrow during a pop
Path Extender: When triggering a pop, you may move one bubble 2 spaces instead of 1
Singularity Affinity ðŸŒŸ
Node Amplifier: Bubble pops adjacent to Singularity Nodes count as if they occurred on the Node
Color Protector: Your color bubbles can only be popped by you
Harmony Collector: Gain 1 bubble whenever any player triggers a pop on a Singularity Node
Node Master: Choose two ability cards instead of one when acquiring from Singularity Nodes
Active Abilities (Triggered on Space Station Spaces)
Bubble Manipulation ðŸ”®
Bubble Placer: Place 2 bubbles anywhere on the board
Color Converter: Change the color of up to 3 bubbles anywhere to match your color
Bubble Attractor: Pull up to 2 bubbles from each adjacent space to your current space
Strategic Planner: Draw 5 bubbles instead from the bag when triggering space station spaces
Cosmic Control ðŸŒŒ
Space Folder: Swap the positions of any two Space Cards (and all bubbles on them)
Cosmic Rotator: Rotate up to 2 Space Cards by 90 degrees in any direction
Node Shifter: Move any Singularity Node up to 2 spaces in any direction
Bubble Director: Choose one space with bubbles and push all bubbles in one direction of your choice (no need to follow the arrow)

STRATEGY TIPS FOR NEW PLAYERS
Plan Ahead: Think about where bubbles will go after a pop and how you can set up chain reactions
Watch Your Supply: Having more bubbles gives you more options, so collect extras when possible
Position Strategically: End your turn where you can take advantage of the action you want next turn
Target Singularity Nodes: Pops on Nodes give you abilities and increased scores
Balance Abilities: Try to collect complementary abilities that work well together
Aim for Consistency: Try to trigger at least one bubble pop every turn

GAME END
The game ends immediately when:
A player collects their 5th Singularity Point marker
A player acquires 5 different types of ability cards
The Bubble Token bag is empty
The Ability deck is depleted
Any player accumulates 25 points from chain reactions
In scenarios 3-5, the player with the most Singularity Point markers wins. In case of a tie, the player with the most points from chain reactions wins.

IMPORTANT RULE CLARIFICATIONS
Resource Limitations
At the start of your turn, if you dont have any bubble tokens in your supply, you may flip one of your ability cards face-down to gain 5 bubble tokens from the bag. The face-down card cannot be used until reactivated at a space Station.
Explorer Boards
All players have an Explorer Board where they track:
Research Data points (from chain reaction)
Stable Wormhole Fragments
Breakthrough Technology cards
bubble supply
bubble Movement
All bubble Grid Cards have at least 2 arrows (dimensional pathways).
When bubbles would propagate off the board, collect them into your bubble supply.
The sequence of bubble propagation in chain reactions occurs in order, starting from the initial collapse and proceeding sequentially (not simultaneously).
